My journey :
**An Inspiring Data Journey:**

My journey from a Data Analyst Intern to a seasoned Team Lead at Amazon has been a tapestry of growth, innovation, and impactful contributions.

Commencing as an intern at Cluster IT, Hyderabad (Sep 2020 - Aug 2021), I delved into the world of data, employing ETL tools and SQL to run queries. The journey continued at Guru Nanak Institutions Technical Campus, India, where a Wireless Aquaculture System project (Final Grade: 85) ignited my passion for harnessing technology to enhance real-world processes.
My academic voyage further flourished at the University of Leicester, where pursuing an MSc in Advanced Electrical and Electronics with Management (Sep 2021 - Nov 2022) earned me a First-Class distinction. The dissertation on driver's drowsiness detection, with an accuracy of 94%, symbolized the fusion of technological prowess with visionary thinking. Venturing into the corporate landscape, my role as a Demand Planner at World Duty Free, London (May 2022 - Dec 2022), became a canvas for precision and collaboration. Advanced Excel skills and forecasting systems were my brushes, painting a success story with a 15% reduction in customer complaints.
Joining the e-commerce giant, Amazon, as a Team Lead in April 2023 marked a pinnacle in my journey. Overseeing nightly shipments and optimizing workforce needs, I implemented KPIs, driving efficiency and transparency. My proficiency in Excel, including Power Pivot and VBA, transformed data into insightful reports, establishing me as a leader. Beyond the professional realm, certifications in Data at Amazon, a Virtual Internship with Accenture, and exploratory data analysis skills from IBM enriched my toolkit. These milestones became stepping stones, equipping me with the skills to navigate the complex data landscape.

As a leader at Amazon, I not only oversee operations but also embody a commitment to safety, providing first aid support during critical moments. Simultaneously, my role as VP of Event Logistics at the Guru Nanak Asian Pacific Student Association reflects my dedication to fostering community engagement beyond the workplace.
This inspiring journey reflects not only a professional evolution but a commitment to continuous learning, innovation, and leadership. From internships to leadership roles, each step has been a testament to the transformative power of data and the endless possibilities it holds.
